The HTTP/2 inspector (H2I) will convert HTTP/2 frames into HTTP/1.1 message sections and feed them
to the new HTTP inspector (NHI) for further processing.

The current implementation is the very first step. It splits an HTTP/2 stream into frames and
forwards them for inspection. It does not interface with NHI, does not provide error detection and
handling, and does not address the multiplexed nature of HTTP/2.
